# Note-Taking-App


## Description
The motivation for this project was utilize express to create back end features for a note taking application.

I built this project to demonstrate my abilities to create back end server configurations.

This problem solves the problem of only creating front end applications.

I learned how to use multiple routes such as GET, POST and DELETE.
